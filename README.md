# DataScienceComplete

* This repository contains codes for all the Data Science Courses that I have done or am doing right now.
* This would include basic Data Visualizations, different Analytics algorithms, ML models as well as Data Science at scale.

## Course 1: <a href="https://github.com/ravi0531rp/DataScienceComplete/tree/master/Data_Science_ML_Based"> Data Science With ML </a>
  * This course explores all the Data Exploration & Visualization Tools like Pandas,MatplotLib,Seaborn to do EDA. Then use Statsmodels,Scikit-learn and other libraries       to do the Machine Learning stuff.
  * The files are in the jupyter notebook format and the hyperlinks will be inside the Project directory's <a href="https://github.com/ravi0531rp/DataScienceComplete/blob/master/Data_Science_ML_Based/readme.md">readMe.md </a> file.
